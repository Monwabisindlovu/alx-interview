# Prime Game

## Description

Maria and Ben are playing a game involving prime numbers. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

They play `x` rounds of the game, where `n` may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, this program determines the winner of each game and the overall winner.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3 or later
