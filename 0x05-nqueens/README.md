The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

### Concepts Needed:
- **Backtracking Algorithms:**
  - Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
  - [Backtracking Introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)
- **Recursion:**
  - Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
  - [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)
- **List Manipulations in Python:**
  - Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
  - [Python Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)
- **Python Command Line Arguments:**
  - Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
  - [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-python/)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
