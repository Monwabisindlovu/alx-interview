0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Project Overview
This project is designed to test your understanding of bitwise operations, UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills. The goal is to write a method that determines if a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
Project Requirements
Write a method def validUTF8(data) that returns True if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, and False otherwise.
A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long.
The data set can contain multiple characters.
The data will be represented by a list of integers, where each integer represents 1 byte of data.
You only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer.
Concepts Needed
Bitwise Operations in Python
UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
