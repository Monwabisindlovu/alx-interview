0x00. Pascal’s Triangle
Description
This project involves the implementation of an algorithm to generate Pascal’s Triangle using Python. Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, with each number being the sum of the two directly above it.

Must Know
Lists and List Comprehensions
Create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
Use list comprehensions for concise and readable code.
Functions
Define and call functions.
Pass parameters and return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
Loops
Use for and while loops for iteration.
Nested loops for generating each row of Pascal’s Triangle.
Conditional Statements
Apply if, elif, and else conditions based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle.
Recursion (Optional)
Understand recursion for an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
Arithmetic Operations
Perform addition to calculate each element of Pascal’s Triangle.
Indexing and Slicing
Access elements and slices of lists for constructing each row of the triangle.
Memory Management
Manage how lists are stored and copied.
Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors.

Tasks
0. Pascal’s Triangle
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0.
Assume n will always be an integer.
