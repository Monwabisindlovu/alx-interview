To complete this project, you'll need to understand:

HTTP Requests in JavaScript: Making HTTP requests to external services using modules like request or fetch.
Working with APIs: Understanding RESTful APIs, interacting with them, and parsing JSON data.
Asynchronous Programming: Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
Command Line Arguments in Node.js: Accessing command-line arguments using process.argv.
Array Manipulation and Iteration: Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures.
